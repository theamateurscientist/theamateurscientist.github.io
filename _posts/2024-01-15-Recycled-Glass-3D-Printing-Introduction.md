# ARTICLE IN PROGRESS
I've recently acquired a DLP resin printer and have been amazed at the resolution it provides. The printer also opens the capability for experimenting with creating ceramic green bodies by mixing fine powder in the resin. This post will document my initial experiments with using recycled glass to create additively manufactured glass objects. My goal is to create a repeatable process that can be followed by other capable makers.

## [Theory](#theory)
In the resin glass printing process, the desired final material must be first finely powdered before mixing with the resin. Since the material does not dissolve in the resin, it in suspension. The material must be fine enough to not settle before printing completes. The mixed resin must also not be too viscous which would prevent the resin printer from operating properly. This limitation limits the percent amount of final material present in the mixed resin. Once printed, the part must be debinded by slowly heating in a furnace. After full debinding, the temperature can be raised to sinter the final material together for a finished part.

I was able to acquire a lot of glass bottles from a friend. The first step was washing the bottles and removing as much label and adhesive as possible. Next, I smashed the bottles in a ziploc bag. The smashed pieces where put through a strainer to isolate smaller grains, then loaded into a ball mill. After milling for several hours, the powder and ball mix was sifted.
