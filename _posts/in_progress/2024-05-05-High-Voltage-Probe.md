I bought a dental X-Ray tube off of eBay recently. The operating voltage for it is around 70kV. In order to not fry this thing, I built a high voltage probe so I can measure the output of my high voltage power supply. Typically, I would just guestimate the output by measuring arcing distance. However, the tube wasn't exactly cheap so I want a bit more reassurance.

The probe is a simple voltage divider that scales the voltage down to a range my multimeter can safely read.
